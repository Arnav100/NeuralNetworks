# NeuralNetworks

This is an experiment for self-education on how to build a Neural Network.
The idea, design and math behind this project is inspired a series of videos from the youtuber 3Blue1Brown 
(https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)

Currently, the networks are able to be saved and loaded for later use.
As an early test, I have created a network which can be used to give an output of a binary xor

After roughly 3-4 minutes of backpropagating against the same inputs, the network functioned with an average cost of
8.93 * 10^-4 

The goal for this project is to be able to identify handwritten numbers. Using data from the MNIST dataset, the 
network will train and hopefully perform well against the test data.
